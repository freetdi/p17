- all types should end with _type
- assigning undirected graph to directed creates symmetric graph
	this is an old HACK...

  to get a symmetric directed graph from an undirected, you should do
  undirected_graph_t U(...);
  directed_graph_t D;
  D = U.directed_view(); // <= will assign both directions, naturally
  (this is untested)
- some assignments are inefficient, preallocation is incomplete
