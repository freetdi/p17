PACE17/A [1] submission -- tdlib/experimental and gala snapshot

USAGE/SYNOPSIS

"make" should build everything needed to run ./tw-exact and ./tw-heuristic.

these programs read a ".gr" file from stdin, and print a ".td" file to stdout.
./tw-exact terminates after finish, ./tw-heuristic will wait for a TERM
signal. -L -D -T flags switches on logging/debugging/tracing.

TW-EXACT

is basically Hisao Tamakis implementation that won last year. It has been ported
to C++11 and boost/gala/tdlib. It is now ran after the tdlib preprocessor. The
development has been discontinued in favor of tw-heuristic.

TW-HEURISTIC

Performs rule based Preprocessing followed by an exaustive but guided brute
force search over elimination orderings. Lower bounds computed by
deltaC_leastC are used to cut off branches. minimalChordal is used to refine
orderings.

EXAMPLE

$ make
[..]
$ ./tw-exact < tdlib/grtd/HoffmanGraph.gr
[..]
$ ./tw-heuristic < tdlib/grtd/HoffmanGraph.gr & p=$!; sleep 1; kill $p

BUGS

signal handling
- too early TERM might not be handled right.
- reaction to TERM may be late.

package
the embedded tdlib package is incomplete and experimental. the proposed
algorithms, subroutines and executables will be made fully available in a
future version of tdlib.
