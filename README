PACE17/A [1] submission -- tdlib/experimental and gala snapshot

"make" should build everything needed to run ./tw-exact and ./tw-heuristic

./tw-exact terminates after finish, ./tw-heuristic will wait for a TERM
signal.

TW-EXACT

is basically Hisao Tamakis implementation that won last year, ported to C++11
and boost/gala/tdlib. The development has been discontinued in favor of
tw-heuristic.

TW-HEURISTIC

An exaustive but guided brute force search over elimination orderings.
